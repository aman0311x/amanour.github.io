I began my journey with a deep passion for computer science, which led me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering at AUST in 2022. From the very beginning of my academic career, I immersed myself in [competitive programming](https://www.stopstalk.com/user/profile/aman0311), sharpening my problem-solving skills and building a solid foundation in algorithms and data structures.

Alongside my academic studies, I actively worked on various [projects](https://github.com/aman0311x), experimenting with different programming languages and frameworks. This hands-on experience allowed me to gain practical knowledge in web development and software engineering.

However, as I delved deeper into the world of technology, I became increasingly fascinated by the field of Artificial Intelligence, particularly in Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLMs), and intelligent agents. Driven by this passion, I decided to shift my focus towards AI research and development.

Currently, I am in my final year, specializing in Image Processing for my thesis. I am exploring advanced techniques and working on innovative solutions to push the boundaries of AI in visual recognition and analysis.
